## Project specification

### Overview

The application is composed of an oriented graph, where each node represents a person.
The color of each node is related to the organization to which it belongs.
The link between each person represents the document they have exchanged.
The user can click on these links to see the content of the related document.

Two additionnals pannels allow to filter the results :
* By creation date : Chronological timeline with selectable interval
* By governmental organisation (FBI,CIA...) : checkboxes

### Target audience
Our project targets people willing to analyze data that were pubished by US national archives,
as it is quite complicated to browse through documents. Indeed nothing is implemented
ti ease this browsing through the thousands of documents.
Thus, our project aims to help, journalists, scientifits, historians, to find and extract useful
information from raw data.

### Motivation
The project idea comes from our curiosity for these newly publicy published documents.
When we wanted to explore them, we were quickly discouraged by the dofficulty of
vizualisation
